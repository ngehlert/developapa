February was a pretty busy month. Everybody was sick, my wife started, followed 
by the kids and currently it is my turn. So.... I didn't had much time for my 
side projects, but there are still some smaller news.
- [Cobalt 2](#cobalt-2)
- [Made my day](#made-my-day)
- [MX Keys](#mx-keys)

## Cobalt 2
For the few long term readers of my blog out there this seems like a Déjà-vu, but 
there is another Cobalt 2 update - again. This time I converted it to a fully custom
UI-Theme for Jetbrains products. The difference to earlier versions is, that now also
sidebar, menubar, contextmenu, etc. is in the theme colors and not just the code editor
itself.

## Made my day
With the next release I introduce couple of languages for Made my day. Those are currently:
* English
* German
* Italian
* Polish
* French
* Swedish
* Spanish (also in the pipeline but probably introduced with the release after the current one)

It actually took me longer to implement the logic and to get all texts translated than I anticipated,
but I think it was worth it and apologize for the delay.  
The release is basically ready and will be pushed to the app store any day (still have to wait for 
Apples verification process) so I hope it will be live withing 1 to 2 weeks.

Currently looking for other features to implement for Made my day, so hit me up if you have any ideas.

## MX Keys
For christmas I got this new keyboard from Logitech, the [MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard). 
Been trying it now for two months and I really really enjoy it. I will write a detailed review about it and 
put a link to it here.
