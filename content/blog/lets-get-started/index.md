Alright, I'm pretty excited so let's go!

My name is Nicolas Gehlert and I'm a software developer from Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany) and as the name suggests
also dad of two small kids.  
This is a project I wanted to do for a pretty long time and finally it was high enough on the side-project-priority-bucket-list.

## What to expect

So in this blog is not limited to a specific topic and instead you'll find a collection of posts on a variety of them.  
For example:
* JavaScript libraries or frameworks I tried in one of my projects
* Basic and advanced JavaScript topics
* Angular
* My life as a dad & developer
* â€¦

## Final thoughts
I appreciate any kind of feedback and criticism, just drop a comment or reach out to me on any other platform like github, twitter, etc.  
Even if there are already a million blogs out there *(and probably about nearly every topic imaginable there are already
dozens of posts)* I strongly believe that everybody can **and should** share his experiences and stories.  
Different people like different styles of writing or maybe sometimes a specific example suits you better in a certain
situation.  
And finally this is also a proof to myself that I have enough knowledge about certain topics to write detailed posts.

I still don't have everything figured out where I want to go with this blog, but I just want to get started. So feel free
to join me on this journey and help me along the way.
