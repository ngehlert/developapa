Hi! Thank you very much for sharing this knowledge. Looks
I have a problem with using your code, because I use &#x27;mdx&#x27; instead of &#x27;markdownRemark&#x27;... also I am very new to Gatsby and I have no idea how to change code and make it work.
I based my blog on gatsby-personal-starter-blog.
Maybe you have some idea how to add comments using &#x27;mdx&#x27; in &#x27;graphql&#x27;?
