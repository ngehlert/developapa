I have client.scss file that was written based on @angular/material@11 but recently I got requirement to update the client.scss to be compatible with @angular/material@15. 

Also, I changed scss file compiler from node-sass to dart sass( formally known as sass). 

I&#x27;m getting compilation errors when I try to compile the newly updated client.scss file. The errors are related to imports. 

I have created a question on stackoverflow but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t got any answers. 

Can someone please help me in fixing the issue?
