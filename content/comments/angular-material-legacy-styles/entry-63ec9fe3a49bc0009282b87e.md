Hi,
Thanks for the post! It saves my week! Everything works fine after that.

I clearly regret my migration. It was so simple before ... 
Material 15 is just awfull (to stay polite) and unnecessarily complicated ... especially with its default fixed font-sized inputs, making all components look enormous and ugly. 
Before it was herited from the context ... it was so simple and intuitive. Now you need to code dozen of sass lines to get it worked (and need to know complex sass things to do a simple css changes)

In my opinion, they make a very wrong step and they gonna loose fans. 
Myself, I am thinking about quiting Material and finding something simpler to manipulate.

So thank you very much for this piece of code which works like a charm.
For your information, I had to replace &quot;$app-theme&quot; by &quot;$my-theme&quot; in the last line.

++
Christophe
