Hi Nicolas,
I downloaded your Made my Day app on three different macs.  I was using it without a problem until last week when the app stopped working on all the computers at the same time.  They computers are: iMac with High Sierra, another Macbook air with Catalina and another iMac with Catalina.  All the computers have different software as they belong to three different people and yet your app stopped working.  When you open it all you get is a blank screen.  Any suggestions for resolving this problem.
