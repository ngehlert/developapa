Hi Nicolas,
maybe it&#x27;s there, but i can&#x27;t find where i change the save directory. I didn&#x27;t know each day saves as a new file, and i want to move the save directory into a new folder.

And i would like some neat print function. Now i can&#x27;t find any print, but maybe a print function that prints 2 days per paper or something like that.

I like the app, but the most important part for me is that i can export it to paper version later, and then i must be able to print it, and if i do this after some year, i don&#x27;t wanna print every day manually. And i don&#x27;t want to print all dates, since it might be a a week between my notes :)
Best Regards
Per
