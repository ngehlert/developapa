Hi Mats,
I generally like the idea. But not quite sure if this would really increase safety/security.
I could add a code to the startup, however the files itself would still not be encrypted - because this would be against the entire purpose of the app to have an open format that can easily be converted into other formats.
Would it be enough to just have a code for startup without changing anything in the files itself? Then you would have the benefit that no one can read your entries when he opens the app, but if you know where the files are stored you could still read them.
Kind regards
Nico
