Thanks for the feedback, sure thing. So from my understanding Angular is going into the direction of a signal change detection that is not relying on zone.js.  
But in order for this to work, you need to have signals in your template as well, otherwise changes to public variables that you want to have represented would not be visible (or you are force to constantly manually call markForCheck())
