Hello, Nicolas. Good article, thanks you! When a saw it for the first time I told to my boss that this is must have feature. He agreed and currently I&#x27;m busy with moving ag-grid to the separate library. The functionality is working well in your example and I&#x27;m really excited about it. But unfortunately it&#x27;s not working in our app. I removed all ag-grid imports from our app, copied your good-lib into our app, updated angular.json and tsconfig.json. But ag-grid is still the part of the main bundle when I import TableModule from good-lib/grid. Could it be some settings in angular that I missed? We started our project from version 8. Maybe some old settings preventing this good-lib to lazyLoad. The packages are indentical to your example but the behavior is different. I believe that I will use your improvements in our project but currently I&#x27;m stuck.
