Hi nks,
unfortunately the Angular team dropped the support for legacy styles with Angular version 17. For now you need to keep your Material dependency to version 16 and migrate to the regular modules instead.
As far as I know Material 16 is perfectly compatible with Angular 17 - but this should really be used for emergencies and you really need to migrate your modules ;)

Best
Nico
